# B-Abbott-HW-8

## Applications used
- Javascript
- Node

## Summary
- In the command line function of bash, once node index.js is run, it will ask for the github username as well as the favorite color
- Once that runs through, it will say that a pdf for that username has been successfully.
- The pdf will also appear on the left side of the page along with the file names.
- I was able to then pull it up in my finder and it gave me the desired information
